                   <h4><p>I studied Chinese and Japanese in college, worked in various industries and in multiple capacities ranging from accounting to Financial Service Consultant before
                settling into a career in software sales and development.</p>
                <p>I previously worked as the Director of Sales Operations and SalesForce CRM for two enterprise software companies where I learned a lot about software sales and even more about SalesForce administration.  In my current role, I am the Director of Systems and I am the 
                product owner of our SalesForce implementation.  It is by far the most challenging role in my career and I hope that I can parlay what I learn in UCLA's Coding 
                Bootcamp to ensure the success of the project.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>In my spare time I like to hike, needlepoint, and play video games.  I don't watch television but I am a YouTube addict so I have a lot in common with your average
                12 year old.</p></h4>
